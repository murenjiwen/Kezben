abstract = {A system for automatically training and spotting signs from continuous sign language sentences is presented. We propose a novel multiple instance learning density matrix algorithm which automatically extracts isolated signs from full sentences using the weak and noisy supervision of text translations. The automatically extracted isolated samples are then utilized to train our spatiotemporal gesture and hand posture classifiers. The experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the automatic sign extraction, hand posture classification, and spatiotemporal gesture spotting systems. We then carry out a full evaluation of our overall sign spotting system which was automatically trained on 30 different signs.},

abstract = {OmniTouch is a wearable depth-sensing and projection sys- tem that enables interactive multitouch applications on eve- ryday surfaces. Beyond the shoulder-worn system, there is no instrumentation of the user or environment. Foremost, the system allows the wearer to use their hands, arms and legs as graphical, interactive surfaces. Users can also transiently appropriate surfaces from the environment to expand the interactive area (e.g., books, walls, tables). On such surfaces - without any calibration - OmniTouch provides capabilities similar to that of a mouse or touchscreen: X and Y location in 2D interfaces and whether fingers are “clicked” or hovering, enabling a wide variety of interactions. Reliable operation on the hands, for example, requires buttons to be 2.3cm in diameter. Thus, it is now conceivable that anything one can do on today’s mobile devices, they could do in the palm of their hand.},

@article{Cerveri2007,
abstract = {This paper describes methods and experimental studies concerned with quantitative reconstruction of finger movements in real-time, by means of multi-camera system and 24 surface markers. The approach utilizes a kinematic model of the articulated hand which consists in a hierarchical chain of rigid body segments characterized by 22 functional degrees of freedom and the global roto-translation. This work is focused on the experimental evaluation of a kinematical hand model for biomechanical analysis purposes. From a static posture, a completely automatic calibration procedure, based on anthropometric measures and geometric constraints, computes axes, and centers of rotations which are then utilized as the base of an interactive real-time animation of the hand model. The motion tracking, based on automatic marker labeling and predictive filter, is empowered by introducing constraints from functional finger postures. The validation is performed on four normal subjects through different right-handed motor tasks involving voluntary flexion-extension of the thumb, voluntary abduction-adduction of the thumb, grasping, and finger pointing. Performances are tested in terms of repeatability of angular profiles, model-based ability to predict marker trajectories and tracking success during real-time motion estimation. Results show intra-subject repeatability of the model calibration both to different postures and to re-marking in the range of 0.5 and 2 mm, respectively. Kinematic estimation proves satisfactory in terms of prediction capability (index finger: maximum RMSE 2.02 mm; thumb: maximum RMSE 3.25 mm) and motion reproducibility (R (2) coefficients-index finger: 0.96, thumb: 0.94). During fast grasping sequence (60 Hz), the percentage of residual marker occlusions is less than 1\% and processing and visualization frequency of 50 Hz confirms the real-time capability of the motion estimation system.},
